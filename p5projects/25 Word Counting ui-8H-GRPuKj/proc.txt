Arise, Ye who refuse to be slaves!
With our flesh and blood,
let's build a new Great Wall!
China is now facing its greatest danger,
everyone is forced to let out one last cry.
Arise! Arise! Arise!
Millions of hearts together
Brave the enemies' gunfire! March on!
Brave the enemies' fire! March on! 
March on! March on! On!
